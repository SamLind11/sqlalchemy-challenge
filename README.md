# SQLAlchemy Challenge Assignment
SQLAlchemy challenge assignment for the UNC Data Analytics Bootcamp

## Description
For this challenge, I wrote a script which queried a SQL database using an Object Relational Map (ORM) in Python.  Provided with a .sqlite file, I mapped the database using SQL Alchemy to perform several queries on the dataset, performing analysis and generating visualizations using Pandas and Mathplotlib.

Additionally, I created an example API for accessing the database using Flask.

## Authors

The .sqlite file and Jupyter Notebook starter code were provided by the UNC Data Analytics Bootcamp.  The ORM implementation, python queries, and API were all written by Sam Lind.
